# Marascuilo-Procedure-test

PROVEAN, SIFT, I-MUTANT, PolyPhen, PHD-SNP, PANTHER, SNPs&GO are seven bioinformatics tools for phenotype prediction using machine learning technique, structural information, and evolutionary information. 

Conduct a chi-square contingency table test to compare the behavior of the existing seven algorithms are different. Then, use the code Marascuilo-Procedure-test to see which algorithm has a significant difference with the best one.
