# Marascuilo-Procedure-test

## Background

The most effective treatments for lysosomal diseases, which are a group of genetic disorders resulting from deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes, should occur before symptoms manifest. And the sooner the treatments begin, the better the results will be. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatments and good clinical outcomes.

PROVEAN, SIFT, I-MUTANT, PolyPhen, PHD-SNP, PANTHER, SNPs&GO are seven bioinformatics tools for phenotype prediction using machine learning technique, structural information, and evolutionary information. 

## Implementation

In order to compare these algorithms to Conduct a chi-square contingency table test to compare the behavior of the existing seven algorithms are different. Then, use the code Marascuilo-Procedure-test to see which algorithm has a significant difference with the best one.
